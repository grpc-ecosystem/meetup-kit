How can we improve? Please let us know whatâ€™s helpful and what we can do better by providing feedback through the dedicated surveys. Here's how:

### For Google Developer Groups

Register your event on developers.google.com/events using the correct event tags (gContent, Cloud)

You will receive an automated email with  personalized links to the surveys.

### For GDEs and All Other Content Bundle Users

Take the final survey after the workshop to [evaluate](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU8U-XKeyHp90FYS7KjA8OxuMAM_G95IvnY18gRM3j6smk_Q/viewform) the content.
